        <p>
        Hello and Welcome!
        My name is JoAnne Salmon, but you can call me Jo ðŸ˜Š
        I am an illustrator and animator with a love for all things creative. 
        I have a background as an animator, storyboard artist and concept artist and have worked in the animation industry for many years. 
        I am now embarking on new adventures.
        </p>
        <p>
        I create my artwork in various styles and techniques such as traditional and digital. 
        I love painting with watercolour, acrylic gouache, and ink. I am always wanting to try new things and explore new works of art. 
        I am based in the UK and all the art works are printed here. 
        My landlordâ€™s cat Margo is the floor manager and makes sure everything is running smoothly and all is in excellent quality. 
        Thank you for stopping by!
        Lots of Love!
        Jo and Margo.
